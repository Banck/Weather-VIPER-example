# Weather-VIPER-example
This is an example of VIPER architeture.
In this project I'm using http://openweathermap.org for getting weather. Note: this service doesn't work in Russia (thanks Roskomnadzor for that), if you are russian, please, use vpn for test.

The VIPER xcode template you can find here: https://github.com/Banck/Swift-viper-template-for-xcode
